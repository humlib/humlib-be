# humlib-be

Backend for HumLib - The Human Library in Computer Science

## Development workflow

We use [GitHub flow](https://githubflow.github.io/) as git branching strategy. It is based on the 6 principles below.

- Anything in the 'main' branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of 'main' (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into 'main'
- Once it is merged and pushed to 'main', you can and should deploy immediately

For commit messages, we use [GitMoji](https://gitmoji.dev/). There is a handy IntelliJ plugin to help you choose the
right emoji. Other than that, a commit message should follow the pattern `:emoji: Short description (#:issue number:)`.

## SDKman

For automatically using Java 17 when entering this repository, simply set `sdkman_auto_env=true`
in `~/.sdkman/etc/config`
This makes sdkman switch to the java version defined in `.sdkmanrc` automatically when you `cd` into this repo.

## CI

You need to have a pull request for your branch to have the defined GitHub workflows executed automatically. On push
to 'main', so basically when a pull request is merged, another run is triggered for 'main'.

The pipeline builds the application and executes tests. It then uploads coverage data and test results as artifacts.
Both are posted as a comment to PRs. Unit test results can also be reviewed as a dedicated check run. Code coverage
results are uploaded to [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/humlib/humlib-be/dashboard?branch=main)

## API first

We use [OASv3.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) to define humlib-be's API. To
edit the API specification, please
use [Postman](https://humlib.postman.co/workspace/HumLib~ad065858-1612-464c-bb89-1992625514ab/overview). Contact one of
the team members to get access.

The API can be generated by running `./mvnw openapi-generator:generate` or the appropriate run config in IntelliJ. The generator does not support OpenAPI 3.1, yet.
Anyway, the generated files are currently not in use.

## Local development (Docker)

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
  using [Docker Compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/) ([Compose file documentation](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md))
- at least 6GB available memory
- each docker container uses 1GB memory per default. Change this behaviour per environment via
    - DOCKER_MEM_LIMIT_ELASTICSTACK
    - DOCKER_MEM_LIMIT_KEYCLOAK

### Setup

- open a terminal
- variant 1:
    - set HUMLIB_BE_HOME in your .zshrc or .bashrc `export HUMLIB_BE_HOME="<path>"`
    - also add `source ${HUMLIB_BE_HOME}/docker/humlib.profiles`
- variant 2:
    - navigate to this directory
    - execute `HUMLIB_BE_HOME=$(pwd) source docker/humlib.profiles` from the repository root

### All services

- start all backend services using `humlib-be-start` or `humlib-be-start-min`
- stop the docker setup with the command `humlib-be-stop` or stop and delete all volumes via `humlib-be-delete`
- you may need to follow usage hints as depicted below

### Elasticstack

version: [8.0.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/8.0/get-started-stack-docker.html#run-docker-secure "documentation")

#### Start and stop commands

- initialize and start the elasticstack via `humlib-be-elasticstack-start`
- if you only want to run elasticsearch, use the command `humlib-be-elasticstack-start-min`
- stop the docker setup with the command `humlib-be-elasticstack-stop` or stop and delete all volumes
  via `humlib-be-elasticstack-delete`

#### Usage

- copy the autogenerated elasticstack certificate to your
  keychain [docker/elasticstack/volumes/certs/ca/ca.crt](docker/elasticstack/volumes/certs/ca/ca.crt 'docker/elasticstack/volumes/certs/ca/ca.crt')
- elasticsearch: [https://localhost:9200](https://localhost:9200 'https://localhost:9200')
- kibana: [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601 'http://localhost:5601')
- logstash: listens for beats input on port 5044 ([localhost:5044](localhost:5044 'localhost:5044')) and reads `*.log`
  -files from the directory `humlib-be/logs`

#### Built-in users

- elastic:elastic (superuser)
- kibana_system:kibana_system

### Keycloak

#### Start and stop commands

- initialize and start keycloak via `humlib-be-keycloak-start`
- stop the docker setup with the command `humlib-be-keycloak-stop` or stop and delete all volumes
  via `humlib-be-keycloak-delete`

#### Usage

- to export changes made to the keycloak instance locally, use `humlib-be-keycloak-export`, wait until a log
  message `Resuming server` appears, and hit Ctrl-c
- keycloak: [https://localhost:8180](https://localhost:8180 'https://localhost:8180')
- mailhog: [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025 'http://localhost:8025')
- mailhog (SMTP): [http://localhost:1025](http://localhost:1025 'http://localhost:8025')
- OIDC realm
  information: [http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/humlib/.well-known/openid-configuration](http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/humlib/.well-known/openid-configuration 'http://localhost:8180/auth/realms/humlib/.well-known/openid-configuration')

#### Built-in users

- admin:admin

### Actuator

For observing the state of the application, you can use Spring's Actuator endpoints offered at port 8081:

- [health](http://localhost:8081/actuator/health 'http://localhost:8081/actuator/health')
- [liveness](http://localhost:8081/actuator/health/liveness 'http://localhost:8081/actuator/health/liveness')
- [readiness](http://localhost:8081/actuator/health/readiness 'http://localhost:8081/actuator/health/readiness')
